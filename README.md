# Pokédex App Project

## Goal
I want to learn the ins and outs of various app development platforms. From native to multi-platform, I hope to learn enough to work on a few other passion projects!

## Synopsis
I'm going to make the same application, a basic PokéDex, multiple times in different languages and frameworks. The goal is that I get a lot of the logic down, transpose a lot of the code, and learn the different intricacies of how the frameworks/languages work.

## ...Why?
Well, because I can build something, right now, in React. Am I a React Dev? No but I can do it without an extreme amount of effort and while still learning. So, my thinking is that I will make something and get the the bulk of the logic figured out. Then, it's my hope that it can be ported pretty easily to React Native where I can knock out one of the language goals. From there, I will be learning the rest but I'll have the logic mostly figured out so I'll have a pretty big head start on a lot of the Dev work. Porting an existing app to a new language or framework is a great way to learn!

## Languages
- React
  - For framing up what I want the others to look like in a language/framework that I'm more familiar with.
- React Native
  - Ideally, I should be able to port a large chunk of the code over from the example/base React application. 
- Flutter
  - Flutter, with the Dart programming language, is something that I have wanted to learn for quite a while!
- Kotlin
  - Native Android development!
- Swift
  - Native iOS development!
- .NET MAUI
  - Microsoft's multi-platform solution. I know C# pretty well and I'm hopeful that this underdog can produce great results!

## Requirements

## Disclaimer
This project was made without the use of generative machine learning. The goal is that I learn and having an LLM do it for me isn't super conducive to that.
