# Pokédex App Project

## Goal
I want to learn the ins and outs of various app development platforms. From native to multi-platform, I hope to learn enough to work on a few other passion projects!

## Synopsis
I'm going to make the same application, a basic PokéDex, multiple times in different languages and frameworks. The goal is that I get a lot of the logic down, transpose a lot of the code, and learn the different intricacies of how the frameworks/languages work.

## Languages
- React
  - For framing up what I want the others to look like in a language/framework that I'm more familiar with.
- React Native
  - Ideally, I should be able to port a large chunk of the code over from the example/base React application. 
- Flutter
  - Flutter, with the Dart programming language, is something that I have wanted to learn for quite a while!
- Kotlin
  - Native Android development!
- Swift
  - Native iOS development!
- .NET MAUI
  - Microsoft's multi-platform solution. I know C# pretty well and I'm hopeful that this underdog can produce great results!

## Disclaimer
This project was made without the use of generative machine learning. The goal is that I learn and having an LLM do it for me isn't super conducive to that.
