# Pokédex App Project

## Goal
Learn the ins and outs of various app development platforms.

## Synopsis
I'm going to make the same application, a basic PokéDex, multiple times in different languages and frameworks. The goal is that I get a lot of the logic down, transpose a lot of the code, and learn the different intricacies of how the frameworks/languages work.

## Disclaimer
This project was made without the use of generative machine learning. The goal is that I learn and having an LLM do it for me isn't super conducive to that.
